## list of projects  
- **custom_axi_ip_acc:** project to show how we can use a Custom AXI IP to accelerate processes executing totally or partially an algorithm on FPGA. https://www.controlpaths.com/2020/07/24/custom-axi-ip-for-acceleration/
- **mpsoc_axis_dma_xfft:** project to show the using of the DMA to perform a FFT using the xFFT IP Core. The project is developed with Trenz TE0802 but is usable for all Zynq MPSOC boards. https://www.controlpaths.com/2020/10/12/using-the-dma-and-axi4-stream-on-zynq-us/
- **matlab_overdrive_effect:** project where an overdrive effect is created using MATLAB to develop the algorithm and a Picozed board with Digilent's I2S2 to implement it. https://www.controlpaths.com/2021/02/08/using-hdl-coder-wfa-to-implement-a-distortion-effect/
- **iio_manage_adc:**  project where an ADC is managed from Petalinux with IIO bus. https://www.controlpaths.com/2021/03/08/using-iio-to-manage-an-adc-from-petalinux/
- **matlab_libiio_axis:**  project that shows hot to generate an AXI4-Stream IP on MATLAB using HDL Coder and LibIIO.
- **axis_biquad:** On this project I will show you how implement a biquadratic filter on Verilog. https://www.controlpaths.com/2021/04/19/implementing-a-digital-biquad-filter-in-verilog/
- **axis_fir** On this project I show you how to develop a FIR filter in verilog using folding. https://www.controlpaths.com/2021/05/16/implementing-a-fir-filter-using-folding/
